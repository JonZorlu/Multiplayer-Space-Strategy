## Motivation

This sample game project consists of FREE Packages and Assets. You may use and extend it in anyway you like. The main purpose of this repo, is to share what I know about making a server authoritative multiplayer 3D Unity game and to give back to the community. 

## Details

All models are Probuilderized, some re-modeled with Probuilder, and their UVs are re-arranged so Game uses just a single Material with a single Texture Atlas for all models.
